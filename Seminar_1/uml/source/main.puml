' NOTES
'

note as N1
	Attributes have a cardinality of 1 unless specified otherwise,
	they also and do not have to be unique.

	The attributes of payment entities
	(**LessonPayment** and **RentalPayment**)
	are used to calculate the final cost of the payment.
	Since the price is derived from the other attributes
	we avoid having to explicitly store it.
end note

note right of lesson
	The different skill levels:
	- Beginner
	- Intermediate
	- Advanced
end note

note right of lessonPayment
	Sibling discount
	does not affect
	payment of the
	instructor.
end note

note right of rentalPayment
	**rentalId** will not have to be unique
	to account for cases where a student
	misses to pay for an instrument
	multiple months in a row.
end note

note top of student
	Contact persons are stored as their person number.
	With that you can retrieve their information.
